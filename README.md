### Inspiration
Imagine you're on dining table with your family on a Christmas evening. You had a lot of fun and made lot of cherished memories but when you woke up next morning , you find out that, you are not able to remember anything about your last night, maybe finding difficulty in remembering your family members names and in worst case, you forgot even your own name. This miserable condition is called ALZHEIMER’S DISEASES or commonly called dementia .This is an example of the severe cases of cognition impairment. Other symptoms could be finding difficulty in concentrating, Attention deficient disorder,Dementia and list goes on. Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions that affect their everyday life. Cognitive impairment ranges from mild to severe. With mild impairment, people may begin to notice changes in cognitive functions, but still be able to do their everyday activities. Severe levels of impairment can lead to losing the ability to understand the meaning or importance of something and the ability to talk or write, resulting in the inability to live independently. More than 16 million people in the United States are living with cognitive impairment! Age is the greatest risk factor for cognitive impairment, and as the Baby Boomer generation passes age 65, the number of people living with cognitive impairment is expected to jump dramatically.An estimated 5.1 million Americans aged 65 years or older may currently have Alzheimer’s disease and this number may rise to 13.2 million by 2050. C.I is costly.The average Medicaid payment for a person aged 65 or older with Alzheimer’s or other dementias is nine times higher than that for other beneficiaries in the same age group. And the happy memories and moments it costs us is ofc invaluable. But what if we can stop it or at least milder it symptoms. Like one once’s said prevention is better than cure. 

### What it does
And so in hope to save our loved once from the jaws of this disease we did some research and a small survey of around 80 self proclaimed C.I patients. And after organising the data we came up with these 6 activities to lower our chances of getting C.I.

Exercise 35 meditation 15% memory games 12% music 9% socialising 8% Diet 8% Socking result because these r just some basic activities that most of us can do on daily basis and thats all. And so we created our application “Cognicue”. The idea of this application is to use the result of our survey and modern technology to create some daily habits which can be huge game changer for pre or early CI symptoms.

### How we built it
We're using java and kotlin as languages to build the android app. There's 2 image classification model built with CNN. The happiness meter was based on the authentic-hapiness.com survey then we create the prediction model with random-forest then we deploy it as an API.We used Firebase for messaging service , authentication and database.We used food api for all the recipe and nutrients details.

## Demo
